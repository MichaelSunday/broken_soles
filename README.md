### Fix an Express app... as a team!

######[our shoe collection app is broken, how will we keep track of our Jordans and Manolos now?]

In this independent practice lab, you'll work with your assigned teams to create a working Express application by adding code to an existing project and using Git/GitHub to collaborate. This is meant to give you a little taste of what's to come during your Project 3 work sprint, where you will work with a team which we've selected for you. You have been given most of the app in the starter code.

Your job is to find and fix the errors that exist in this starter app. There are at least **7** errors, so make sure to catch them all!


**The team that fixes this app will be able to have full CRUD funcitonalty when working with your app in Insomnia or cURL.**

To start:

- The team leader should fork and clone the broken_soles repo to their GitHub
- The other member(s) of the team should fork and clone the team leader's repo, so they have a local copy and can start working
- Rely on the *Git Workflow Cheatsheet* ["Programmer & Manager"](https://github.com/keyanbagheri/broken_soles/blob/master/git_workflow_cheatsheet.md#our-workflows) workflow for this lab
